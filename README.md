# **BERT Meta-Learning and Bayesian Hyperparameters Optimization for Regression**

This project demonstrates the application of BERT-based sentence embeddings, PCA, and one-hot encoding for feature engineering, followed by a robust regression analysis using Bayesian Optimization to tune various machine learning models. A stacking ensemble with a meta-learner is also implemented to further enhance predictive performance.

The project leverages Python with popular libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, optuna, sentence-transformers, and scipy.sparse.

## **Introduction**

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for building and optimizing regression models, particularly focusing on handling diverse feature types including numerical, categorical, and textual data. The core idea is to transform the input data into a rich feature space and then employ advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques to find the best-performing models, ultimately combining them using a stacking ensemble.
The input information of the model is the parameters of construction projects, along with the history of changes (described in natural language). From there, the models perform analysis and predict the actual costs of these projects. Detailed descriptions of the inputs and outputs are presented in Table 1.

## **Usage**

1. **Place** your **data:** Ensure your Excel data file (20250430@DesignChange.Sumaried.AfterPCA.anonymized.xlsx or similar, as expected by the notebook) is in the root directory of the project, or update the data loading path in the notebook.  
2. **Run** the Jupyter **Notebook:** Open and run the share\_bert\_meta\_learning\_and\_bayesian\_hyperparameters\_optimization\_ipynb.ipynb notebook cell by cell. The notebook contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training, optimization, and evaluation.

## **Data**

The project expects an Excel file with the following (or similar) columns:

* **Project ID**: Unique identifier for projects.  
* **PC1 \- PC6**: Numerical features (likely principal components).  
* **C1 \- C5**: Categorical features.  
* **T1**: Textual feature (e.g., descriptions or notes related to design changes).  
* **Y1**: The target numerical variable for regression.  
* **L**: Another numerical feature (its role is not explicitly defined in the provided snippets but is present in the dataframe).

The notebook handles data loading and checks for missing values.

## **Methodology**

### **Feature Engineering**

* **Numerical Features (PC1-PC6, L):** Used directly after scaling.  
* **Categorical** Features (**C1-C5):** Transformed using OneHotEncoder to create binary features for each category.  
* **Textual Features (T1):** Processed using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model ('all-mpnet-base-v2') to generate dense vector embeddings. These embeddings capture semantic meaning from the text.  
* **Feature Stacking:** All processed features (numerical, one-hot, and sentence embeddings) are horizontally stacked into a single sparse matrix (X\_num\_oh\_word\_tfidf).

### **Bayesian Optimization (Optuna)**

Optuna is used to find optimal hyperparameters for the base models. For each model, an objective function is defined that trains the model using 5-Fold Cross-Validation on the training data and returns the average Mean Squared Error (MSE). Optuna then explores the hyperparameter space to minimize this MSE.

Hyperparameters tuned include:

* **Lasso/Ridge:** alpha (regularization strength), fit\_intercept.  
* **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** n\_estimators, learning\_rate, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, subsample.  
* **Random Forest Regressor:** n\_estimators, max\_depth, min\_samples\_split, min\_samples\_leaf, bootstrap.

### **Stacking Ensemble**

The stacking ensemble combines the predictions of the base models.

1. **Out-of-Fold (OOF) Predictions:** Each base model generates predictions on the validation folds during its cross-validation training. These OOF predictions form the training data for the meta-learner (X\_train\_meta\_bo).  
2. **Test** Set **Predictions:** Each base model also predicts on the unseen test set, and these predictions are averaged to form the test data for the meta-learner (X\_test\_meta\_bo).  
3. **Meta-Learner:** A Lasso Regression model is used as the meta-learner, trained on the OOF predictions of the base models to learn how to best combine their outputs. Its hyperparameters are also optimized with Optuna.  
4. **Final Prediction:** The meta-learner makes the final predictions on X\_test\_meta\_bo.

## **Models Used**

**Base Models:**

* Lasso Regression (sklearn.linear\_model.Lasso)  
* Ridge Regression (sklearn.linear\_model.Ridge)  
* Gradient Boosting Regressor (sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor)  
* Random Forest Regressor (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor)

**Meta-Learner:**

* Lasso Regression (sklearn.linear\_model.Lasso)

## **Results**

The performance of each optimized model (Lasso, Ridge, GBR, RF, and the Stacking Ensemble) is evaluated on the test set using:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
* **R-squared (RÂ²)**  
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
* **Mean** Absolute Percentage Error **(MAPE)**

The notebook outputs the best hyperparameters found by Bayesian Optimization for each model, along with their respective evaluation metrics. The stacking ensemble typically achieves the best overall performance.

Example output snippet for Stacking Ensemble:

\--- Best Stacking Ensemble (BayesOpt Meta-Learner: Lasso) \---  
Test MSE (Stacking \- BayesOpt): 2.3850293266880402e+13  
Test RÂ² (Stacking \- BayesOpt): 0.940888218122135  
Test RMSE (Stacking \- BayesOpt): 4883676.204139706  
Test MAPE (Stacking \- BayesOpt): 0.11559909067533342

Best parameters for Meta-Learner (Lasso \- BayesOpt): {'alpha': 97.10916550995319, 'fit\_intercept': False}  
Bayesian Optimization Time: 6555.61 seconds

## **Visualizations**

Scatter plots are generated to visualize the "Actual vs. Predicted" values for each model, allowing for a quick visual assessment of their performance and areas of prediction deviation. A perfect model would have all points lying on the diagonal line.
